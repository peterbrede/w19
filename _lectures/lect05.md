# Topics

## Review



## Lesson plan

* Review C-style implementation of linked list from CS16
	- Creating a list
	- Iterating through a list
    - Modifying a list (appending elements to the end)

* Review Pointers (pointers to basic types and pointers to structs) and Dynamic memory allocation (new and delete) with use cases

* Linked lists as an ADT (implementation using classes)

* Revisit the big four for linked list

C++ provides a default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator for any class that doesn't have one explicitly defined.
