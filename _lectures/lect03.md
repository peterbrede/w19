# Topics

## The big four
* Constructor 
 	- Default and parameterized constructors (Review)
	- Initializing const member variables using a constructor with an initialization list
* Destructor
* Copy-constructor
* Copy-assignment

## Non member functions and friend functions

## Review of pointers and dynamic memory allocation
* Review of pointers, arrays
* Passing parameters by value and address
* Passing arrays to functions
* Dynamic memory allocation and dynamic arrays


## Makefiles
* We will split our implementation of the die Game from the previous class into three files  - header file (contains only the class definition), source file (contains the implementation of the class methods - no main), test file - uses the ADT. (More practice on this in lab02)
